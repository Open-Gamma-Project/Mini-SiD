# Minimal SiPM Board

Minimalistic board that allows you to quickly and easily utilize a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) within your other projects. Supports a range of input voltages, has a digital (TTL) pulse output for the registered counts and a direct output for the amplified pulses to include some kind of peak detection for gamma spectroscopy.

Build your own scintillation counter with this board! All you need is a scintillator and a SiPM and you can use it like a Geiger counter (but better).
